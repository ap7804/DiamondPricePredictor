## Pipelining Explanation

The project follows a modular structure, with separate components and pipelines for different stages of the machine learning workflow:

- **Components**: 
  - `data_ingestion.py`: Handles the ingestion of raw data.
  - `data_transformation.py`: Performs preprocessing and feature engineering on the data.
  - `model_trainer.py`: Trains machine learning models on the preprocessed data.

- **Pipelines**:
  - `training_pipeline.py`: Combines the data ingestion, transformation, and model training components into a single pipeline for training.
  - `prediction_pipeline.py`: Combines the data ingestion and transformation components with the trained model for making predictions.

These pipelines allow for easy separation of concerns and reusability of code. For example, the training pipeline can be used to train different models with minimal changes, and the prediction pipeline can be deployed in a production environment to serve real-time predictions.
