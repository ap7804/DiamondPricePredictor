## Pipelining Explanation
The project follows a modular structure, with separate components and pipelines for different stages of the machine learning workflow:

- **Components**: 
  - `data_ingestion.py`: Handles the ingestion of raw data.
  - `data_transformation.py`: Performs preprocessing and feature engineering on the data.
  - `model_trainer.py`: Trains machine learning models on the preprocessed data.

- **Pipelines**:
  - `training_pipeline.py`: Combines the data ingestion, transformation, and model training components into a single pipeline for training.
  - `prediction_pipeline.py`: Combines the data ingestion and transformation components with the trained model for making predictions.
